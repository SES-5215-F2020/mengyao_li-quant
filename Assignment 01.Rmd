# 1. Load tidycensus, tidyverse, dplyr, httr, knitr
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)
library(knitr)
```

# 2. Load household-level data from the 1-year American Community Survey Sample from 2018
I want to do a household-level analysis. 
```{r}
household_variable_2018 <- pums_variables %>%
  distinct(year, survey, var_code, var_label, data_type, level) %>%
  filter(level == "housing", year == 2018, survey == "acs1")
```

# 3. Fix connection problem
I am constantly getting an error message "Failed to connect to api.census.gov". I have searched online for different methods. This chunk solves my problem.
```{r results='hide'}
 set_config(
     use_proxy(url="127.0.0.1", port=7890)
 )
 httr::GET("https://www.census.gov/")
```

# 4. Choose 5 variables:
After looking through the variables available in household_variable_2018, I have chosen the following five variables:

     - Food stamp (FS) (categorical)
     - Laptop (LAPTOP) (categorical)
     - Household income (HINCP) (continuous)
     - Number of own children (NOC) (continuous)
     - Property Value (VALP) (continuous)
     
I want my sample to include all households in New York State. 
Through those data, I would like to explore the relationship between household income and property value, number of children, food stamps, and laptop. The following questions can find an answer through this analysis: "Do richer families spend more on housing?", "Do they tend to have more children?", "Does more children means more laptop?", "Is there a correlation between income and food stamp used?", etc.   
```{r results= "hide"}
household_data <- get_pums(variables = c("FS", "LAPTOP", "HINCP", "NOC", "VALP"),
                           state = "NY",
                           year = 2018,
                           survey = "acs1",
                           recode = TRUE) 
```

# 5. Select and present columns from household_data dataframe
This dataset includes 196,967 households. The first ten rows are presented here as a formatted table.
```{r}
hh_data <- select(household_data, "FS", "LAPTOP", "HINCP", "NOC", "VALP")
knitr::kable(hh_data[1:10,])
```

# 6. Saving data
```{r}
write_csv(hh_data, "household data_01.csv")
```
